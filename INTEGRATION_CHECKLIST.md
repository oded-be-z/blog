# Integration Checklist - What Needs to be Done

## ✅ COMPLETED (Infrastructure)
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow fixed
- [x] Import errors resolved
- [x] Path issues fixed
- [x] Git worktree system working
- [x] HTML formatter ready
- [x] All credentials stored in GitHub secrets

## 🔧 NEEDS YOUR ACTION

### 1. Fix Zapier Webhook (REQUIRED)
**Status:** ❌ Currently returning 404 Not Found

**What to do:**
1. Go to your Zapier dashboard: https://zapier.com/app/zaps
2. Find the webhook/zap for blog article delivery
3. Check if it's active - if not, recreate it
4. Get the new webhook URL
5. Update GitHub secret:
   ```bash
   gh secret set ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL --body "https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/YOUR_NEW_URL" --repo oded-be-z/blog
   ```

### 2. Enable Real Content Generation (REQUIRED)
**Status:** ❌ Currently in simulation mode

**What needs to happen:**
The system needs to be modified to call actual AI services instead of returning mock data.

**Two Options:**

#### Option A: I (Claude Code) implement it for you
You can ask me to:
1. Replace simulation mode with real Azure OpenAI GPT-5 calls
2. Integrate Perplexity API for market research
3. Implement the actual content generation agents
4. Test the full end-to-end flow

**Say:** "Please implement the real content generation using GPT-5 and Perplexity"

#### Option B: You want to review/customize first
We can:
1. Create the agent implementation together
2. You review the API integration code
3. Test incrementally before going live

**Say:** "Let me review the implementation plan first"

### 3. Test Full Workflow (AFTER #1 and #2)
Once GPT-5 and Zapier are connected:
```bash
# Trigger a test run
gh workflow run "Daily Blog Automation" --repo oded-be-z/blog

# Watch it execute
gh run watch --repo oded-be-z/blog
```

## 📊 Current System Flow (As Built)

```
GitHub Actions Workflow (6:00 AM IST Daily)
  ↓
Main Orchestrator (Python)
  ↓
PHASE 1: Setup ✅
  ↓
PHASE 2: Create Git Worktrees ✅
  ↓
PHASE 3: Launch 3 Agents ❌ (SIMULATION - needs implementation)
  ├─→ Forex Agent → Should call Perplexity API → GPT-5 → Translate
  ├─→ Crypto Agent → Should call Perplexity API → GPT-5 → Translate
  └─→ Commodities Agent → Should call Perplexity API → GPT-5 → Translate
  ↓
PHASE 4: Merge Branches ✅
  ↓
PHASE 5: Quality Validation ✅ (but validating mock data)
  ↓
PHASE 6: Zapier Delivery ❌ (webhook broken)
  ↓
PHASE 7: Cleanup ✅
```

## 🎯 What Happens When Fully Implemented

```
Daily at 6:00 AM IST:
1. Workflow triggers automatically
2. Creates 3 parallel worktrees
3. Launches 3 AI agents in parallel:

   FOREX AGENT:
   - Calls Perplexity API for EUR/USD market data
   - Generates article with GPT-5-Pro
   - Translates to Arabic (Gulf), Spanish, Portuguese with GPT-5
   - Fetches EUR/USD chart image
   - Creates 4 HTML files (one per language)

   CRYPTO AGENT:
   - Calls Perplexity API for Bitcoin market data
   - Generates article with GPT-5-Pro
   - Translates to 3 languages
   - Fetches Bitcoin chart image
   - Creates 4 HTML files

   COMMODITIES AGENT:
   - Calls Perplexity API for Gold market data
   - Generates article with GPT-5-Pro
   - Translates to 3 languages
   - Fetches Gold chart image
   - Creates 4 HTML files

4. Merges all 3 branches into main
5. Validates 12 total articles (3 topics × 4 languages)
6. Delivers to Zapier webhook
7. Cleans up branches and worktrees
8. You receive 12 ready-to-publish articles daily
```

## 💰 Cost Estimate (When Fully Operational)

**Daily:**
- Perplexity API: 3 calls × $0.01 = $0.03
- GPT-5-Pro: 3 main articles × $0.10 = $0.30
- GPT-5: 9 translations × $0.05 = $0.45
- **Total per day: ~$0.78**

**Monthly:**
- **~$23.40 for 12 articles per day**
- 360 total articles (3 topics × 4 languages × 30 days)

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Check current workflow status:
```bash
gh run list --repo oded-be-z/blog --limit 5
```

### View latest workflow logs:
```bash
gh run view --repo oded-be-z/blog --log
```

### Manually trigger workflow:
```bash
gh workflow run "Daily Blog Automation" --repo oded-be-z/blog
```

### Update secrets:
```bash
# Zapier webhook
gh secret set ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL --repo oded-be-z/blog

# Azure OpenAI (already set)
gh secret list --repo oded-be-z/blog
```

## 📝 Summary

**You have a working infrastructure, but the "brain" (AI content generation) is not connected yet.**

**What you built:** The skeleton, bones, nervous system
**What's missing:** The brain making decisions and creating content

**Next step:** Tell me to implement the real AI integration, or we can plan it together first.
