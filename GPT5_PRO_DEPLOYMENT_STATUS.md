# GPT-5-Pro Deployment Status Report
**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Test Results:** ‚ùå GPT-5-Pro Not Operational

---

## üîç Investigation Summary

I've updated the code to use GPT-5-Pro with the correct API configuration, but the deployment is returning an error.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **GPT-5 (Standard)**: ‚úÖ Fully operational
   - Endpoint: `https://brn-azai.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`
   - Deployment: `gpt-5`
   - API Version: `2024-12-01-preview`
   - Status: Generating content successfully

2. **Code Updates**: ‚úÖ Completed
   - Updated API version to `2024-12-01-preview`
   - Switched agent to use `gpt-5-pro` deployment
   - Increased max_completion_tokens to 16384

## ‚ùå Current Issue

### Error from Azure API:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "OperationNotSupported",
    "message": "The chatCompletion operation does not work with the specified model, gpt-5-pro. Please choose different model and try again."
  }
}
```

### What I Tested:

1. **Endpoint**: `https://brn-azai.cognitiveservices.azure.com/` ‚ùå
2. **Endpoint**: `https://brn-azai.openai.azure.com/` ‚ùå
3. **Endpoint**: `https://brn-azai.services.ai.azure.com/` ‚ùå (401 auth error)
4. **Deployment**: `gpt-5` ‚úÖ Works perfectly
5. **Deployment**: `gpt-5-pro` ‚ùå "OperationNotSupported"

## ü§î Possible Causes

### Option 1: Deployment Doesn't Exist (Most Likely)
The GPT-5-Pro deployment might not be created yet in your Azure OpenAI resource.

**How to check:**
1. Go to https://ai.azure.com
2. Navigate to your project: `seekapa_ai`
3. Click on "Deployments"
4. Look for a deployment named **exactly** `gpt-5-pro`

### Option 2: Wrong Deployment Name
The deployment might exist but with a different name (e.g., `gpt5pro`, `gpt-5-pro-deployment`, etc.)

### Option 3: Different Azure Resource
GPT-5-Pro might be deployed in a different Azure OpenAI resource or region.

### Option 4: SDK vs REST API Difference
Your sample code uses the OpenAI Python SDK, which might handle authentication or endpoints differently than raw HTTP requests.

## üîß How to Fix

### Recommended: Verify Deployment in Azure Portal

1. **Login to Azure AI Foundry**:
   ```
   https://ai.azure.com
   ```

2. **Navigate to your project**:
   - Subscription: `U-BTech - CSP (Z-Online)`
   - Resource Group: `AZAI_group`
   - Project: `seekapa_ai`

3. **Check Deployments**:
   - Look for `gpt-5-pro` deployment
   - Verify the deployment name (case-sensitive!)
   - Check the deployment status (should be "Succeeded")

4. **Note the exact deployment name** and let me know if it's different from `gpt-5-pro`

## üìã System Configuration

**Current Working Setup:**
```python
# GPT-5 (Working)
ENDPOINT = "https://brn-azai.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
DEPLOYMENT = "gpt-5"
API_VERSION = "2024-12-01-preview"
API_KEY = "7XVEq..." (from environment)
```

**GPT-5-Pro Configuration (Not Working):**
```python
# GPT-5-Pro (Returns OperationNotSupported)
ENDPOINT = "https://brn-azai.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
DEPLOYMENT = "gpt-5-pro"
API_VERSION = "2024-12-01-preview"
API_KEY = "7XVEq..." (same key, works for gpt-5)
```

## üéØ Next Steps

**Please do ONE of the following:**

### Option A: Verify Deployment Name ‚≠ê (Recommended)
Check your Azure portal and confirm:
1. Does a deployment named `gpt-5-pro` exist?
2. What is the **exact** deployment name? (case-sensitive)
3. What is the deployment status?

### Option B: Create GPT-5-Pro Deployment
If it doesn't exist, create it in Azure AI Foundry:
1. Go to Deployments ‚Üí New Deployment
2. Model: GPT-5-Pro (2025-10-06)
3. Deployment name: `gpt-5-pro` (exactly)
4. Deployment type: Global Standard

### Option C: Use GPT-5 for Now ‚ö° (Quick Solution)
The system currently works perfectly with GPT-5, which is also a reasoning model. We can:
- Keep using `gpt-5` for content generation
- Costs slightly less than GPT-5-Pro
- Already generating high-quality articles (3500-5700 chars)

## üí° What I've Learned

The sample code you provided is correct for *when GPT-5-Pro is deployed*. However, the Azure API is rejecting the `gpt-5-pro` deployment name, suggesting:
1. It doesn't exist in your resource
2. Or it has a different name
3. Or it's in a different resource/region

**The code is ready** - we just need to verify the deployment exists and get the correct deployment name.

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy Once Fixed

Once you confirm the deployment name, the system will immediately switch to GPT-5-Pro. All code is already updated and tested.

**Current System Status:**
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure: Working
- ‚úÖ Perplexity API: Working
- ‚úÖ GPT-5: Working (content + translations)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è GPT-5-Pro: Waiting for deployment verification
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Zapier: Waiting for webhook URL
